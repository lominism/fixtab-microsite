This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for a microsite that is meant to run only on mobile. In other words, if you're looking at it on a regular browser, it will look a little weird. Go to dev mode and put it on mobile. 

## Getting Started

1) Download code
2) npm install
3) npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
